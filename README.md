Stopwatch web Application

To develop a stopwatch web application, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are essential components. HTML serves as the foundation for structuring the application elements. By incorporating functions for initiating, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as capturing and presenting lap times, users can precisely measure and document time intervals. Through the utilization of these technologies and features, a sophisticated and user-centric stopwatch web application can be crafted.
